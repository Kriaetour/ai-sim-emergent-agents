Before the first winter, The Open Few triumphed over The Forest Market, repelling invaders from The Wise Bridge in a campaign of unyielding valor. The Bound Bond was vanquished by The Trading Council's vassalized forces, their domains subjugated to the whims of The Flung Hearth. Meanwhile, The Hooded Bond and The Wild Walkers suffered similar fates at the hands of The Forest Bridge and The Restles, respectively.

Yet peace is a fragile thing — The Open Few vanquished the Forest Market, their valiant resistance repelling the invaders and securing the Wise Bridge's safety. The Bound Pilgrims' vassalage to the United Bond was cemented in the aftermath of the latter's triumph over the Wild Walkers. Meanwhile, the Hooded Bond thwarted the United Bond's attempted conquest, reclaiming victory for their realm amidst the tumultuous tides of war.

The great wars came, and the land bore witness: The Open Few, The Trading Council, and The Bound Pilgrims triumphed over The Hooded Bond, vanquishing their foes in battle. The Wild Rovers fell to The United Bond, whose dominion now spans the land. In two great wars, The Wise Bridge repelled both The Forest Market and The United Bond, earning eternal renown among its people.

Now only The Open Few, The Trading Council, The Bound Pilgrims, The Open Bridge, The Elder Pact, The Wild Rovers, The Woven Ones, The Sworn Hearth, The Lone Road, The Iron Bridge, The Bound Shade endure. 100 souls perished across 1000 ticks of mortal struggle, and 57 factions passed into memory.
