# Emergent AI Civilization Simulator

> **Watch factions form, trade, war, betray, and mythologize —
> all from simple survival rules. No scripted behavior. Pure emergence.**

---

## What Is This?

Thirty nameless inhabitants are dropped onto a Perlin-noise-generated world. They eat, migrate, and slowly build trust with their neighbors. From that trust come shared beliefs. From those beliefs come factions. From faction rivalry comes trade — and war. Tech trees create asymmetric advantages. Diplomacy builds fragile alliances. Inhabitants form families, bear children, and pass their beliefs to the next generation. When enough time passes, the old world shatters and a new era dawns.

None of it is scripted. Every war, betrayal, and alliance you see is unique — because the civilization that produced it was unique.

An optional LLM mythology layer can write chronicles, myths, and epitaphs using a local model via Ollama — but the simulation runs fully standalone. A live Streamlit dashboard shows the world map, faction borders, and reputation graph updating in real time.

Fully playable on a **$150 Intel N95 mini-PC with 16 GB RAM**. No GPU required.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Starting inhabitants | 30 |
| Population cap | 1,000 (configurable) |
| Simulation layers | 9 (0–8) |
| Ticks per run | 10,000 (configurable) |
| Terrain generation | Perlin noise (height + moisture + depth) |
| Biomes | 6 — forest, plains, mountains, desert, coast, sea |
| LLM mythology | Optional — disabled by default |
| External API calls | Zero |
| Scripted events | Zero |
| Python dependencies | `noise`, `streamlit`, `plotly`, `numpy`, `streamlit-autorefresh` |

---

## Features

### World & Terrain

- 🌍 **Three-field Perlin terrain** — Height, moisture, and depth noise fields produce coherent biome layouts across a dynamically-scaled grid. Sea coverage is calibrated to 25% of the map via depth-noise percentile thresholding — guaranteed regardless of random seed.

- 🗺 **Six distinct biomes** — each with unique movement costs, resource caps, and survival characteristics:

  | Biome | Move Cost | Notes |
  |-------|-----------|-------|
  | Plains | 5 (baseline) | Default food + ore |
  | Coast | 5 | Port bias for settlements; fishing when Sailing researched |
  | Forest | 10 (0.5× speed) | 2× food density (cap 28); dense but slow |
  | Desert | 7 | Surface scrap ore (cap 30); sparse food |
  | Mountains | 9 | High stone; rough terrain |
  | Sea | 8 | Impassable without Sailing tech; 2× travel speed for sailors |

- 🌊 **Navigable seas** — Sea tiles block movement until a faction researches Sailing (Industrial tier 2). Sailors traverse sea at 2× effective range. Coastal factions with Sailing earn passive fishing income (+1 food per member every 3 ticks on coast tiles). Settlements prefer coastlines (port bias).

- 🧭 **Cost-adjusted pathfinding** — Inhabitants score neighbors by `food × (5 / move_cost)`: plains win over desert treks, forests are lucrative but slow, sailors exploit sea lanes. No A* needed — emergence from local greedy choice.

- 📦 **Biome integer IDs** — Each tile stores a compact `biome_id` int for fast O(1) comparisons in hot loops. Sea tiles are skipped entirely during resource regeneration (~25% of tick work eliminated on N95 hardware).

- 🌱 **Population-scaled food** — Resource regeneration scales with population pressure (`1.0 + 0.5 × pop/cap`). An extinction guard doubles food output when population drops below 10% of the cap.

- ❄ **Seasons** — A 50-tick cycle with an 8-tick winter window. Winter halts food regeneration (reduced to 0.125×); spring restores it (0.25×). Five resource types: food, wood, ore, stone, water.

- 🏙 **Dynamic map scaling** — The grid starts at 8×8 and expands every 25 ticks as population grows, generating new biome tiles while preserving existing terrain.

### Settlements

- 🏰 **Permanent towns** — Factions that remain stable in one location for long enough found a Settlement: a named town with housing capacity, storage (surplus food reserves), and optional walls.

- 🛡 **Walled cities** — Settled factions can build walls; outsiders navigating walled tiles treat them as having 1/3 the food score (effective deterrent without hard barriers).

- 📊 **Settlement index** — A spatial registry enables O(1) settlement lookup by tile coordinate, used during combat, procreation, and navigation.

### Inhabitants & Procreation

- 👤 **Survivors, not agents** — Each inhabitant moves, gathers food, and builds individual trust scores with every person they meet. They starve, migrate, and die with no guidance. Memory-efficient `__slots__` (20 attributes including `_can_sail`) keeps RAM low at 1,000 population.

- 👶 **Generational procreation** — Pairs on the same tile with mutual trust > 15 and food > 10 each can produce a child. Children inherit 50% of their parents' combined beliefs, cost 5 food per parent, start with 10 food, and are born with trust of 30 toward each parent. Settlement housing caps are respected. One birth per tick maximum; no births during winter.

- 📛 **135 fantasy names** — Four name pools (Original, Norse, Celtic, Germanic). When all base names are taken, `get_unique_name` appends Roman numeral suffixes (II–X) then numeric (11+) to guarantee uniqueness across generations.

### Beliefs

- 🙏 **27 event-driven beliefs** — Beliefs form organically from experience: survive a winter → `endurance_rewarded`; trade successfully → `trade_builds_bonds`; watch a neighbor starve → `trust_no_group`. Each inhabitant holds up to 8 beliefs. Co-located neighbors with mutual trust > 10 have a 50% chance to share beliefs each tick.

### Factions

- 🏛 **Organic faction formation** — When three nearby inhabitants (Manhattan distance ≤ 2) share ≥ 2 core beliefs and mutual trust > 8, a faction coalesces around them. Faction names are generated from belief-keyed adjective/noun components ("The Iron Wanderers", "The Salted Few").

- ⚡ **Schisms & mergers** — Ideological minorities (≥ 30% of members) split off every 25 ticks. Solo-member factions within range can merge every 10 ticks. Four ideological conflict pairs block joining and trigger splits. Factions can also diplomatically merge when reputation is high enough.

- 🏰 **Territory & pooling** — Factions control territory chunks, pool 20% of surplus food into reserves, and nudge drifting members back toward their land. Members beyond size 10 with `self_reliance` leave voluntarily.

### Economy

- 💰 **Living economy** — Each faction mints its own currency (15 possible names: shells, iron bits, marked stones…). Dynamic pricing adjusts every 5 ticks based on supply/demand (clamped 0.5×–4×). Trade routes form after 3 successful trades and give +10% bonus (+20% for allies). Scarcity shocks reduce a random resource by 15% globally every 50 ticks.

- ⚔ **Raids** — When tension exceeds 35 between factions, 20% chance per tick to raid. Loot scales with tech: scavenging (2×), weaponry (3×), steel (4×). Raiding breaks treaties and costs reputation.

- 📊 **Gini coefficient** — Wealth inequality is tracked globally across all inhabitants using inventory value plus currency holdings.

### Combat

- ⚔ **Multi-tick wars** — War declarations require crossing a tension threshold of 200 (modified by beliefs and tech). Attackers and defenders recruit alliance chains (60–80% chance per eligible faction). Battles run tick-by-tick with morale-weighted strength. Fallen warriors become named legends.

- 🏳 **War outcomes** — Surrender at 50%+ losses, ceasefire if both sides are broken, or exhaustion after 40 ticks. Winners claim territory. Losers pay 30% food tribute for 20 ticks. 40% of losers are absorbed into the winning faction; 30% flee to neutral factions; 30% remain.

### Technology

- 🔬 **16-tech research tree across 3 branches:**

  | Branch | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  | **Industrial** | Tools | Farming, Sailing | Mining, Engineering | Currency |
  | **Martial** | Scavenging | Metalwork | Weaponry, Masonry | Steel |
  | **Civic** | Oral Tradition | Medicine | Writing | Code of Laws |

- ⛵ **Sailing** — Unlocks sea traversal for all faction members (`_can_sail = True`). Sailors navigate sea tiles at 2× effective score and earn passive fishing income on coast tiles every 3 ticks.

- 🧠 **Belief-driven AI selection** — Factions choose research based on dominant belief affinity (16 belief→branch mappings). Engineering reduces all future research durations by 20%. Research pauses during war and resumes after.

- ⚔ **Combat bonuses** — Metalwork +30%, Weaponry +50%, Steel +80%. Masonry +20% defense. Medicine heals hunger damage and grants 50% plague resistance.

### Diplomacy

- 📜 **Council votes** — Factions with 3+ members vote on war (60% threshold), alliances (50%), new members (50%), and research (50%). Beliefs influence voting. Close votes seed internal tension that can trigger future schisms.

- 🤝 **Formal treaties** — Non-Aggression Pacts (cap tension at 100), Trade Agreements (+20% bonus), Mutual Defense Pacts (auto-join ally wars), and Tribute Pacts (imposed by 3× stronger factions). All last 50 ticks. Breaking a treaty costs −3 reputation.

- ⚖ **Surrender terms** — Belief-driven: `community_sustains` → annexation, `the_strong_take` → tribute, `migration_brings_hope` → exile, `the_wise_must_lead` → vassalization.

- 🌟 **Reputation** — Integer −10 to +10 per faction (reviled → legendary). Recovers +1 every 25 peaceful ticks. Factions with surplus food can share with needy neighbors for +2 reputation.

### Live Dashboard

- 📊 **Streamlit dashboard** (`dashboard.py`) — run alongside the simulation for a live 2-FPS view of the world. Auto-refreshes via `streamlit-autorefresh`; falls back to a manual refresh button gracefully.

- 🗺 **World map** — Plotly `imshow` over an H×W×3 RGB biome image (sea=blue, forest=dark green, plains=yellow-green, desert=tan, mountains=gray, coast=cadet). Faction members overlaid as coloured scatter dots; hover shows name, size, reputation, and techs.

- 📈 **Reputation chart** — Line traces for the top 5 factions over the last 3,000 simulation ticks, with dashed **Allied** (+5) and **Reviled** (−5) reference lines.

- 📋 **Sidebar metrics** — Tick, Alive count, Tick Rate (rolling 30-tick average), Max Generation, Active Factions, per-faction badges (settler status, rep emoji).

- ⚡ **N95-safe I/O** — `dashboard_bridge.py` writes `dashboard_data.json` only every 25 ticks via atomic `os.replace()` (temp-file swap). The dashboard reads with `@st.cache_data(ttl=2)` so it never fights the simulation for disk or CPU.

### Anti-Stagnation

- 🌋 **World events** (every 200 ticks) — Plague (−20 HP all), Golden Age (resources restored), Migration (8 newcomers), Earthquake (2 chunks destroyed), Discovery (free tech to random faction).

- 📅 **Era shifts** (every 500 ticks) — All tensions halved, +33% food globally, new era announced. Eras are named dynamically: The Crimson Years, The Age of Iron, The Great Famine, The Long Peace, etc.

- ⚡ **Disruption events** — Triggered by prolonged stagnation or too few factions: Great Migration (10 newcomers, 2 instant rival factions), Plague Sweeps (−30 HP, food halved), Civil War (largest faction splits), Promised Land (barren chunk restored), Prophet (lone visionary arrives).

- ⏱ **Peace escalation** — At 50 ticks of peace, suspicion grows (+10 tension all pairs). At 75 ticks, resource envy flares (+30 tension on a random pair). At 100 ticks, a mysterious death incident triggers +50 tension and resets the peace tracker.

- 🧳 **Traveler waves** — Every 40 ticks, if population is low or factions are too few, 5–10 newcomers arrive with food and biome-appropriate beliefs. Solo-faction members waste away (−10 HP every 10 ticks) to prevent lone holdouts from stalling the simulation.

### Mythology (Optional)

- 🪦 **LLM narrative layer** — Disabled by default (`MYTHOLOGY_ENABLED = False`). When enabled, a local LLM writes chronicles every 50 ticks, faction creation myths every 100 ticks, and epitaphs for fallen warriors. A Tolkien-style final epic summary is saved to a timestamped `history_*.txt` file. The system prompt casts the model as "an ancient, nameless scribe of the void."

- 📝 **Manual chronicle export** — When mythology is disabled, the simulation writes structured era data to `manual_chronicle.txt` every 50 ticks, suitable for feeding to any external LLM later. A separate `era_export.txt` captures the last 100 events each period.

- 🔒 **Read-only observer** — The mythology layer never modifies simulation state. It degrades gracefully with fallback text if Ollama is unavailable.

### Emergent Variety

- 🔄 **Every run is different** — Different seeds produce different terrain, belief clusters, faction names, wars, and alliances. The same code produces The Merchant Pact one run and The Iron Shore the next.

### Chronicle Entry (Tick 200–250)

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  THE CHRONICLE — Age of Ticks 200–250
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  In the age of wars, The Lone Bond raised its banner against The
  Trading Bridge, and the heavens shook as five factions answered the
  call to arms. Emra of The Bound Ones fell first, at the coast of
  (0,2), a champion of loyalty brought low by conquest's hunger. The
  Trading Bridge, steadfast in community, repelled the invasion and
  exiled its aggressors to the far wastes.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Epitaphs

```
  🪦  Fenn: Fenn of The Lone Bond, noble warrior fallen at battle's
      heart; in unwavering loyalty and strength he kept the ancient oath.

  🪦  Sera: Here lies Sera of The Bound Ones — endurance rewarded,
      the wise must lead. She proved both, and fell proving them.

  🪦  Yeva: Here lies Yeva of The Salted Bridge, who fell defending
      self reliance.
```

### Faction Myth

```
  📜  MYTH of The Restless Few:
        In times past, when The Salted Bridge stood unyielding against
        our fury, we marched beneath loyalty's banner across the scarred
        plains. By divine decree our creed was forged in conflict —
        endurance is not given, it is carved from loss.
```

```

Each layer is a pure function over shared state. Layers 0–7 are deterministic Python. Layer 8 (mythology) is the only one that touches a network socket — disabled by default. The dashboard bridge writes once every 25 ticks via atomic `os.replace()`, so running the dashboard in parallel has no measurable impact on simulation speed.

The terminal output is selectively filtered: only notable events (war declarations, births, deaths, treaties, tech discoveries, schisms, era shifts) appear live via a keyword filter. Full tick-by-tick detail goes to a timestamped log file in `logs/`.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — only needed if you enable the mythology layer

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Kriaetour/ai-sim-emergent-agents
cd ai-civilization-sim

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the simulation
python sim.py
```

### Live Dashboard (optional, but recommended)

Open a second terminal and run the dashboard while the simulation is running:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:8501** in your browser. The world map, reputation graph, and event feed update automatically at 2 FPS as the simulation writes snapshots every 25 ticks.

To enable the LLM mythology layer:

```bash
# Pull a model (any Ollama-compatible model works)
ollama pull internlm2:1.8b-chat-v2.5-q4_K_M

# Set MYTHOLOGY_ENABLED = True in config.py, then run
python sim.py
```

## Hardware

| Tier | Spec | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Minimum (tested)** | Intel N95 · 16 GB RAM | Pure sim runs easily; mythology adds LLM wait time |
| **Comfortable** | Any modern CPU · 16 GB RAM | Full 10,000-tick run in minutes |
| **With GPU** | Any iGPU/dGPU supported by Ollama | Mythology calls become near-instant |

No GPU is required. The simulation itself is pure Python and runs without any LLM. The optional mythology layer calls Ollama with `keep_alive: 0` (immediate VRAM release) and `gc.collect()` after each inference to minimize memory pressure on shared-memory iGPU systems.

Several optimizations target N95-class hardware specifically: sea tiles (~25% of the grid) are skipped during resource regeneration, biome comparisons use integer IDs instead of string equality, the spatial partition replaces O(n) neighbor scans with bounded-radius lookups, and the event log is capped at 200 entries in RAM with overflow archived to disk.

---

## Configuration

Key settings in `config.py`:

```python
# Ollama / LLM (only relevant when mythology is enabled)
GAME_MODEL        = "phi3:3.8b-mini-4k-instruct-q4_0"
NARRATIVE_MODEL   = "internlm2:1.8b-chat-v2.5-q4_K_M"
OLLAMA_URL        = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT    = 150         # seconds per LLM call

# Feature flags
MYTHOLOGY_ENABLED = False       # True → enable LLM chronicles; False → manual export

# Population
POP_CAP           = 1000        # hard ceiling; world food scales up as population grows

# LLM tuning
LLM_TEMPERATURE   = 0.7
LLM_MAX_TOKENS    = 200         # default ceiling; overridden per call type
```

In `sim.py`:
```python
TICKS = 10000   # Change to run shorter (300) or longer simulations
```

In `dashboard_bridge.py`:
```python
DASHBOARD_WRITE_EVERY = 25   # ticks between dashboard snapshots (increase to reduce I/O)
```

---

## File Outputs

| File | When | Contents |
|------|------|---------|
| `logs/run_*.txt` | Every run | Full tick-by-tick log of all events |
| `dashboard_data.json` | Every 25 ticks | Live snapshot: biome grid, faction positions, reputation history, event tail |
| `manual_chronicle.txt` | Every 50 ticks (mythology disabled) | Structured era events + perished names for external LLM use |
| `era_export.txt` | Every 50 ticks | Last 100 events + era summaries |
| `history_*.txt` | End of run (mythology enabled) | Tolkien-style epic summary generated by LLM |

## Roadmap

- [x] **Generational agents** — children inherit beliefs and faction membership from parents
